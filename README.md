This AI project uses Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) to predict diamond prices based on various physical and categorical features. It leverages a machine learning pipeline that includes data loading, visualization, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation â€” all packaged in an interactive Python class.

The DiamondsLearningAgent_MLR is a semi-autonomous agent designed to:

Load and preview diamond data

Visualize relationships between features and price

Preprocess and encode data

Key Features
ðŸ§¾ Loads CSV Data
Reads in diamonds.csv with various diamond attributes

ðŸ“ˆ Pre-model Visualization
Generates scatter plots (e.g., table vs. price) to reveal patterns

ðŸ”§ Data Preprocessing
Uses one-hot encoding for categorical data like cut, color, clarity

You can run by:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/diamonds-learning-agent.git
cd diamonds-learning-agent

pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn

File the attached csv file then run program:
python diamonds_learning_agent.py
